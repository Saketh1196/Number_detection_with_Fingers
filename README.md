# Number_detection_with_Fingers

In this project, Fingers are counted and displayed on the screen. A Webcam is used to detect the fingers shown by the input user and also displays the corresponding image saved in the folder on the screen. Number of frames that were recorded per second was also shown on the screen. The following libraries are used in the program

```
import cv2
import os 
import time
import HandTrackingModule as htm
import mediapipe as mp
```

### Result
